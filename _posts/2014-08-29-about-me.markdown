Hi there! My name is David Aristoteles Kevas Metanfanuan Junior. I'm a Data Science student in Airlangga University in Surabaya, Indonesia. Currently I'm in my third semester and this is my midterm project. 

On my first semester, I took part in the National Data Science Competition with my friends. Although we didn't win, I thought it was an interesting experience.
